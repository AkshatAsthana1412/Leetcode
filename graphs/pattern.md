## Hints to look for in questions to solve using graph theory:

| Question Mentions | Likely Tool |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
Shortest path | BFS
All possible transformations | BFS/DFS
Reachability| BFS/DFS
Islands, regions, grids | Graphs (DFS/BFS, Union-Find)
Build order / dependencies | Topological Sort (DAG)
Optimizing cost | Dijkstra / Bellman-Ford
Components, cycles | DFS, Union-Find
Transitions between valid states  | Graph
